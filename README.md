# ProofLab Frontend

ProofLab is your gateway to understanding and comparing Zero Knowledge proof systems. Our platform provides comprehensive benchmarking and performance analysis tools for the ZK ecosystem, making it easier to evaluate and choose the right proving system for your needs.

## What is ProofLab?

ProofLab's leaderboard serves as the central hub for Zero Knowledge proof system benchmarking. Think of it as the "HuggingFace for ZK" - a platform where developers can:

- Compare performance metrics across different ZK implementations
- Analyze resource usage and efficiency
- Make informed decisions about which proving system best suits their needs

## Features

### Comprehensive Benchmarking
- Side-by-side performance comparisons
- Detailed resource utilization metrics
- Standardized testing environments

### Rich Data Visualization
- Interactive performance charts
- Resource usage analysis
- Timing breakdowns for different proving phases

### Detailed Analytics
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization metrics
- Proof generation timings
- System-specific metrics

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the ZK community! Whether it's submitting new benchmarks, improving documentation, or enhancing the platform, please feel free to:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Submit a pull request

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
